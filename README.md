It's 4th and Goal in the Super Bowl with 1 second left... The Browns are down by 4 points! They had the ball to star running back Nick Chubb. The user controls Chubb with the arrow keys and if he crosses the goal line the Browns win the superbowl, if he steps out of bounds, they lose. Collison won't matter because no1 would be able to tackle him in this situation.
